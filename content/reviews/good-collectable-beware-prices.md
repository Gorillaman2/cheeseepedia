I happen to have this item from a Christmas present so might as well review. Its a great time capsule of the era- yet also such a strange merch item with the giant logo and the not very CEC-esque coloring. 

Thankfully nothing was cheapened out on for it being an in-store exclusive. The only thing to watch out for nowadays are the usual issues with G1 ponies. There's the rusted washer holding the tail together, though that can be swapped out, cleaned, and replaced with a zip tie pretty easily. Also mold can leech into the vinyl if it wasn't stored properly, which can spread to other vinyl figures of the era.

Mine showed up in excellent condition so I've had no issues, just watch out for the eBay prices on these things. Mine I think was $60? But a lot of the listings can jump to $100+. This horse is not worth that much so just wait for a good sale. You can get most ponies in entire batches for like $10-20 from this era so even its current price is a bit overkill.
