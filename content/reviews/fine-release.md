The biggest problem is the fact the album is really restricted on what songs it can use given the Rock-afire's massive catalogue of copyrighted songs they played, which were also usually their best performances.
I think this is the best possible album in the case of working around that, so its good, and the songs are placed well, but sometimes the transitions can be rough due to skirting around skits or other songs in the audio. A really great decision was having Sal's Birthday at the end followed by It's Time to Go, that re-contextualizes the album as someone listening to songs at ShowBiz, having their birthday celebration, and having to say goodbye after their party. 
Its a novelty, nothing new in it, but for what it is the execution was the best they could manage.
