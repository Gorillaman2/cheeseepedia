It insists upon itself. All joking aside, This is a new low, maybe there has probably been worse. But cmon, AI "Song", Innuendos (Average Youtooz Video), Plush no one wanted, It's a modern CEC bingo. Can't wait for the AI Rockstar Album.
Anyways, I really hope CEC starts making Actual Art again soon. Hope they pay Jaret Reddick for this, but that would probably bankrupt the company. At least it's not technically CEC this time so, good job, I guess.
At least it has a Cool Plush IDK I'm so tired of this company throwing out actual Creativity for Slop.
