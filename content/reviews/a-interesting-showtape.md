This was a interesting showtape and a fun one with a mix of 90s songs which is a interesting concept.
My favorite part/segment has to be I won't give up because that song tells me to never give up in life which really shows a positive message and if people need a good starter Coach Chuck showtape this
 is a good choice for them.
