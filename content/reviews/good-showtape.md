This is a great showtape, period. 

There are a lot of good moments in the Movie Magic segment, from awesome song covers (Up Where We Belong was my favorite) to Mr. Munch's (terrible) movie impressions. 

Then there's TV Themes. Boy oh boy, where do I begin with this...? All in all, great segment, awesome covers. Some were like beyond amazing, such as Gilligan's Island (perfect instrumentation and use taking turns singing), Superman, Batman, and my personal favorite, Helen singing the Star Trek theme. The execution to that was PERFECT. Even those high note sound so beautiful!
