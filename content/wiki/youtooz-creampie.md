***BOOTACULAR Chuck E. Cheese üßÄüçï #youtooz #chuckycheese #chuckecheese #halloween*** was an advertisement on TikTok by Youtooz featuring their upcoming {{< wiki-link "Youtooz Bootacular Chuck E. Cheese 9in. Plush" >}}, released on October 11th, 2025.{{< cite 1 >}}

## History
The ad featured the standard Youtooz promotion video, showing a prototype of the plush at both a front and back angle to music. The music however was taken from another video on TikTok by user 'billyclams' titled *'Best Chuck E. Cheese song from the 80s #chuckecheese #funnysongs #animatronic #funnyvideos #cream'*. The original video features an AI generated performance of {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics" >}} to an AI generated song using Rockstar Chuck E.'s voice (voiced by Jaret Reddick).{{< cite 1 >}}{{< cite 2 >}}{{< cite 3 >}}{{< cite 4 >}}

The song's lyrics go "Creampie for me, creampie for you, creampies for all, its all we can do", being an obvious sexual innuendo, and in the context of the video being a jab on the fact AI generation can make copyrighted characters say anything, or to catch people thinking the video is real.{{< cite 4 >}}

It is unknown if the Youtooz team understood the sexual nature of the audio, the fact it was AI generated, if they asked CEC Entertainment for approval and release of the ad, and if Jaret Reddick had approved to his voice being used in AI generated content for Chuck E. Cheese.
