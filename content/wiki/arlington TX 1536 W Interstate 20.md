***Arlington, TX (1536 W Interstate 20)*** is the first {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. Cheese Adventure World" >}}, set to open in early November of 2025.

## History

The location would be registered with the Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation on June 30th, 2025, marked as 'CHUCKE'S ADVENTURE WORLD' and 'ARCADES & ENTERTAINMENT CENTER'. The project was set to have already started on June 1st, and was set to complete by November 1st of the same year. The cost of the project was estimated at $800,000. {{< cite 7 >}}

The first mention of an Adventure World location would from a limited email survey sent out on July 17th, 2025. {{< cite 1 >}} Shortly after this, employee communications would reveal that the internal plans were to have the sub-brand be like a Chuck E. Cheese location, but without an arcade and featuring the Adventure Zone, which consists of Chuck E.'s Superhero Playground and the Trampoline Zone. It would also be communicated that the {{< wiki-link "Brandon, FL (1540 W Brandon Blvd)">}} store would be the designated store used to sell around the idea. {{< cite 2 >}}

On July 21st, Adventure World would make an apperance on the Promoted Companies website, represented by PC to look for valid real-estate in the Dallas Fort-Worth area, with site requirements of 12,000-18,000 sqft. AI generated concept art would show a building with slides, ball-pits, and indoor playgrounds adorned with CEC branding. A mock up of a building showing what the exterior design would look like was also shown, later found out to be of the Arlington location itself. {{< cite 3 >}}

On August 15th, CEC would do a press release for Adventure World, confirming a location in Arlington, TX with around 12,000 sqft. would open in early November, with 5-6 additional stores planned to open in 2026. {{< cite 6 >}} The same day, fans would discover the prior Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation page, giving the store's exact address.

On October 2nd, job listings for the location would open for Game Room Attendant, Party Host, Cashier, Kitchen. Assistant Restaurant Manager listed on the 3rd, and Senior Assistant Restaurant Manager opened on the 10th. {{< cite 8 >}}{{< cite 9 >}}{{< cite 10 >}}{{< cite 11 >}}{{< cite 12 >}}{{< cite 13 >}}

On October 14th the first documented visit to the location would show the signage and logos up, confirming the final planned logo for Adventure World. The left side of the previous tenant's exterior blue paint was changed to tan. Posters in the window for hiring and 'Every Game Is Only One Point' would be seen. Multiple shipping containers would be present in the parking lot, and the interior was barren with mainly tools and equipment around the floor.
