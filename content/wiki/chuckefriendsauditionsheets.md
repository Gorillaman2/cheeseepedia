The ***Chuck E. And Friends! Audition Sheets*** was a leaked set of documents on October 26th, 2024, alongside the {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. And Friends! Story Bible" >}}. The leak likely came from someone auditioning for the roles in the show. 

## Contents
The sheets go over lines from the Christmas pilot, dubbed in the Story Bible as the 'Holiday Special', though in the sheets as the 'Christmas Surprise Party'. A summary of the expectations for the voice and a description of the character are given, alongside example characters the voice is expected to sound near. Lines are taken out of the script for the pilot, with the relevant character's parts highlighted. Auditions are for Pasqually, Bella B., Leggymos, Santa, and 'Troll King / Charity Santa'. It is unclear if where these auditions were posted had more characters lined up.
