***Chuck E. Cheese's - I'm Da Greatest / Biggest Fan*** is a Chuck E. Cheese labeled record sung by Joseph G. Ajhar and published by *B.O.O. Music* in 1985.

## Release

It is currently unknown if these records were ever released in any Pizza Time Theatre locations, though is possibly the case in a select few franchise locations in the Pacific Northwest, or even just a single store from that area. Franchise locations during the time had leeway to run their stores to their owner's discretion, and an unauthorized record using the CEC trademark was possible.{{< cite 1 >}}
This release was later followed up by the {{< wiki-link "Chuck E. Cheese & The Ratkateers (1985)" >}}, though it is unknown if the cassette was ever released.
