***Madame Oink II*** was a showtape featured at both the {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (370 S Winchester Blvd)" >}} and {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}} (and possibly the {{< wiki-link "Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd)" >}}) *Pizza Time Theatres* in early-mid 1979. {{< cite 1 >}}

## History
The birthday show for the tape would be recorded at Corasound Recording (122E Paul Drive, San Rafael. CA 94903) on November 13th, 1978. Both a variant with Crusty the Cat and Mr. Munch would be made for each store.

It is unclear when Madame Oink II released. Given it debuted at both of the first stores, it was likely a few months after the opening of {{< wiki-link "San Jose, CA (1371 Kooser Rd)" >}} with their debut Helen Henny character and showtape, but the November 1978 recording session shows it was already in the works before that store opened. Going off a similar timeline, the birthday featured in {{< wiki-link "Sally 1 / Xmas / USA" >}} was recorded April 24th, 1979, and debuted in November. {{< cite 2 >}} This could place the tape right when the third {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre" >}} location opened at {{< wiki-link "Concord, CA (1975 Diamond Blvd)" >}} around the last week of May, 1979. That would mean the show released for all three stores. This would follow a similar pattern to Helen's debut showtape at Kooser Road. Contrary to this, Concord's building plans had an illustration of the main showroom which was approved on March 8th, 1979, which features Foxy Colleen as the guest star.

## Show List
It is unclear what shows were featured on this tape, or if any of them were recovered. It is possible the shows discovered on the CDs recovered for the {{< wiki-link "Pizza Time Theatre Showtape" >}} contain the tracks from this tape, but it also isn't out of the possibility that these contained ones featured on {{< wiki-link "Madame Oink I" >}} or both tapes.

Additionally, a recording of the song 'You Only Hurt the Ones You Love', originally sung by Crusty and on the CDs, was found redubbed by Munch and dated 1979. This confirms the song was included on Oink II, but it is unknown if it originated from Oink I. {{< cite 3 >}}

The only other confirmed show is the Birthday Show, which was recorded on November 13th, 1978. {{< cite 1 >}}
