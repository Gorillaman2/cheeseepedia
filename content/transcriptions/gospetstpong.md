VOL Four no. 1977 date APRIL ATARI®

INTRODUCING... the Pizza Time Theatre Gang... starring me, the "Big Daddy", and M.C. of the Atari Theatre, Chuck E. Cheese! I would like to take a few moments to introduce my very talented co-stars. Ol' Jasper standing to my right chewing on a hunk of straw is the doggondist banjo strummer and coun-try singer you'll ever hear. Behind him flies my whipping boy, Crusty, the Cat's Meow in singing & joke telling. To the left of Crusty, jolly Pasqually clicks his heels to the smell of his soon-to-be world famous pizza (he is our singing Chef who also announces food orders in his authentic Italian dialect). Surrounding our group are the fine-feathered Warblettes, the Soul Singing Magpies just in from the East to entertain you! All seven of us here, plus a few periodic surprise appearences by well-known top stars... such as Elkton John and Glen Camel... will be performing at the soon to be opening CHUCK E. CHEESE'S PIZZA TIME THEATRE! And now I would like to invite each of you Atarians to share in the excitement and come see us at Town and Country Village, San Jose, to enjoy the...

We hope you will be able to attend... after all, Pasqually would like to introduce his new finger kissin' pizza, his new high-protein pizza which features whole-wheat crust containing protein equivalent to a 1/? lb, sirloin steak. Pasqually only uses the highest quality ingredients available in his pizza and his eight different types of hot sandwiches. In addition, he offers a salad bar and the new food rage-- frozen yogert with many exotic toppings!

While enjoying our joll yItalian's menu, you will have a chance to applaude our ani-mated shows Our stars will be performing a total of ten skits on opening night, including four original songs, 2 joke routines, 3 skit dialouges and 1 patriotic medley.

Employee of the MONTH

The month of April presents... our Atari Ham, who enjoys ham-ming it up on his ham radio! Our cheep wine conniosseur putts over the Santa Cruz mountains in his white Chevy every morning responding to his call sign WA6-UPE and chatting to his pals to and from work. Our blue-eyed beach bum loves to gather up his family and head on down to the beach (not too far from their home in Santa Cruz). Led by the fearless Mimi, his 14-year-old dog, they enjoy a good old-fashionmed weeny and sand roast. Before the days of ham radios and barefoot strolls down the beach... our daredevil used to en-joy autocrossing his Corvette and hopping on his motorcycle to pop a few wheelies (rumor has it he was a pretty good rider). Our grinning em-ployee has been employed at Atari since May, 1975... he was hired as a Manu-facturing Engineer, promoted to Fac-ilities Engineer, and has recently been promoted to Facilities Manager! To a well-known figure when there is a job to be done, and done right, and a popular name on the paging system... Dennis Gregory... conratulations for a job thouroughly done!

CHOW NOW:

Hooray! Atari is going to have a new cafeteria, a real cafeteria, with fresh sandwiches, hot food and salads. In addition to a full lunch menu, breakfast will also be served to the early birds. The cafeterial will be ??? ??? ??? Consumer Building.

ANOTHER 3-DAY WEEKEND COMING UP:

Monday, May 30, 1977, will be a paid company holiday to honor Memorial Day. Enjoy!

Yaa, ahh, ahh, I told you all I wanted was your blood! Would you believe one hundred sixteen red-blooded Atarians donated some absolutely scrumptious corpuseles to the Red Cross blood cen-ter? All that blood in exchange for 100 dozen cookies, some fruit juice, & a few hours off work! If you missed out on rolling up your sleeve last month, Atari is proud to an-nounce that you have another chance: On August 29 Atari will be having another Blood Drive, and would like to invite you to offer an arm in help-ing. Oh, thank you again for your "warm" contribution ???
