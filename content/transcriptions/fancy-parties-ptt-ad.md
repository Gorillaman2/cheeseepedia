**Young boy:**

Itâ€™s tough being a kid. Fancy parties, scratchy clothes, and you have to smile no matter what! 

**Aunt:**

Oh! Give Auntie a big kiss! 

**Young boy:**

See what I mean?

**Kids: (Singing)**

But at Chuck E. Cheese you can act like a kid

You can have more fun than you ever did

You can giggle  

You can wiggle 

You can flip your lid!

Chuck E. Cheese

Where a kid, can be a kid!
