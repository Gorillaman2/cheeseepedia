This is a Chuck E Cheese's University production let the entertrainment begin

**Todd Horchner:**

Our main goal at Chuck E. Cheese’s in Pizza Make is to ensure a quality product in 10 minutes or less.

**Mr. Munch: (Walkaround)**

Hey Todd, when is it that we get to eat, huh?

**Todd Horchner:**

Munch, Munch. And remember cleanliness and preparation are key to a smooth running kitchen.

Every guest leaves happy and our guests always come first! Let's look at the Pizza Make and Oven Cut expectations. Provide each guest with a quality product, weigh your toppings per the portion chart and verify the order before cooking. Provide quality products in 10 minutes or less. Provide assistance to others involved in guest service. Teamwork is key, and makes everyone’s job easier. Keep the make table and cut station stocked. Refer to daily, weekly, cleaning schedules. We want our restaurant kept clean, so clean as you go! The products you will be responsible for preparing are: pizza, breadsticks, sandwiches, and hot dogs. Let’s get started. Always make sure that your make table is fully stocked with the freshest ingredients. It will help you save valuable time when you’re busy or on a wait. Refer to the make table preparation chart located in the kitchen for product prep, and refer to the diagram for specific placement. Nearly all the ingredients are prepared before distribution, then transferred from the box into lexan containers at the restaurant. However, Canadian bacon is cut into quarter slices and then stored in the container. To make the garlic spread for both pizza crusts and breadsticks, place a large empty cup on the scale. Next, zero out the scale, fill the cup to 16 oz weight on the scale with liquid margarine. Be sure to shake the gallon container well. Pour into a 1/16th size lexan container. Zero out the scale, fill to 1 and ½ oz weight with garlic power. Pour into liquid margarine and stir very well. Now to Pizza Make. Always begin with a fully proofed crust. Quality identifiers of a fully proof crust are: the bottom lip of the crust is very puffy, 2 to 3 times its original thickness. The lip of the crust is well rounded and full. When the bottom is pressed lightly with your finger, the finger impression should remain in the dough and the dough does not spring back. The crust is soft and slightly moist, not crusty, hard, or dry. Not wet and NO signs of condensation. Now, let’s take a minute and talk about kitchen tickets. There are 2 types: Dart, or Fas Fax. The type you will have depends on the individual store. You must be able to locate 4 main topics on each ticket. They are: time, red ticket number, food order, number of plates to be delivered. To begin an order, take the ticket from the kitchen printer. It is extremely important you be able to read the portion control chart for single, multiple, and super combo pizzas. Once you have a fully proofed crust, top the pizza with a heaping ladle of sauce using the appropriate sized ladle. Spread the sauce over the surface of the crust using a flat spatula for complete coverage. The center of the pizza should have only a thin layer of sauce, with heavier coverage towards the outer edges. Don’t get any sauce on the lip of the crust or it will burn. Distribute the cheese portion evenly over the sauce, working from the outer edge to the center of the pizza. Shake the pan gently to evenly distribute the cheese. Avoid heavy coverage in the center of the pizza. Distribute the remaining topping portions in the order listed on the portion chart. Here’s an example of a medium Canadian bacon and mushroom pizza. First step, using the proper amount of sauce, 4 oz. And the proper amount of cheese, 7 and ½ oz. Now follow the column in the white for the first topping, Canadian bacon, 2 and ½ oz. And follow the color coded column for the second and all additional toppings. Here mushrooms, 1 and ¾ oz. For a combo pizza: sauce 4 oz, cheese 7 and ½ oz. the toppings, pepperoni 1 and ¼ oz, sausage 1 and ¾ oz, and beef 1 and ¾ oz. Now finish with the toppings: green peppers, onions, mushrooms, and olives. Always work from the outer edge to the center of the pizza to ensure even distribution, being careful not to center load the pizza. And always remember to place each topping on separately, don’t mix them together. Place your pizzas on the conveyor belt at the oven entrance once the ticket has been verified for accuracy. Pizzas with 2 toppings or less should be placed on the window side of the oven, while pizzas with 3 or more toppings should be placed to the back side of the oven. What a perfect pizza! Pasqually would be proud. For breadsticks, use fully proofed breadstick skins. Double check the attributes of a fully proofed crust. Very gently brush the garlic spread evenly over the entire surface of the dough, be careful not to press the dough while brushing. Evenly distribute a level 2 oz souffle cup of parmesan cheese over the surface of the dough. Shake to ensure even coverage. To cook, carefully lift the breadsticks and parchment out of the pan by lifting 2 opposite corners of the paper and place them directly onto the oven belt. Place into the window side of the oven and bake one pass through. When no pizzas are to be made, take the time to clean the make table and the floors. Clean as you go!

**Todd Horchner:**

You guessed it! It’s time for Oven Cut. 

**Mr. Munch: (Walkaround)**

I cut that one, haha! 

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Voiceover)**

First, be sure your cut and sandwich stations are set up properly and all your prep work is done. This will save you valuable time when the kitchen is busy and allow you to concentrate on your food presentation. Also, timing the oven and checking the temperature setting are critical to achieving that properly baked pizza. First, let’s look at the hot dog procedure. In a pan, roll the bun halfway in one sheet of Reynolds foil and place the hot dog on the other half. For a cheese dog, apply ¾ oz of cheddar cheese onto the bun. Place the pan into the oven towards the entrance side of the halfway point. While the hot dog is cooking, set up the plate, dividing it into thirds. On one third, place the condiments picture side up. On another third, place the potato chips. The final third is where the hot dog will be placed. When the hot dog exits the oven, remove the foil from the bun and place the hot dog onto the bun. Place the hot dog on the remaining third of the plate, and call out the service time.

Before the breadsticks exit the oven, preset the basket. Now, spread a long flat spatula under the breadsticks off the parchment and onto the cutting board. Using a pizza knife, cut the breadsticks in half, cut each half in half, then cut four pieces in half. 7 cuts = 8 pieces approximately 1 inch wide. Put the smaller piece on the bottom, larger pieces on top. Place the order in the pickup window and call out the service time.

Now for your sandwich preparation. Begin by removing one french roll from a covered 12 quart container. Slice the thawed french roll in half crosswise so the top and bottom are of equal thickness. For the Italian sub, layer the bottom of the roll with 16 pepperoni slices placed flat, overlapping slightly so that the entire bottom of the roll is covered. Stack 2 oz of sliced ham, stacking the ham loosely on top of the pepperoni. Mounding the ham from one end of the roll to the other. Lay 2 slices of provolone cheese over the ham and place in the oven. Now for the ham and cheese, layer the bottom of the roll with 2 slices of provolone cheese, folding it over so that it does not drape over the edges. Next, measure 2 and ½ oz of ham and mound the ham loosely over the cheese across the sandwich from end to end. Lay 2 additional slices of cheese over the ham, do not fold. For both sandwiches, place the bottom of the roll onto a small double stacked pizza pan. Place the top of the roll, cut side down, on a pan parallel to the bottom of the roll. Place the pan in the pizza oven through the side window, positioning it according to the type of oven used. Place the pan in the oven so the top of the roll is in front and the bottom of the roll is in back. Remove the top and bottom of the roll from the pan using tongs or a spatula and transfer to a cutting board at the sandwich assembly station. Complete the sandwich by layering the following over the meat and cheese: 3 tomato slices, 1 oz shredded lettuce, and 5-6 onion rings. Generously sprinkle vinegar, oil, seasoning blend, and parmesan cheese over the lettuce and onions. Spread the cut surface of the top of the roll lightly with mayonnaise. Place the top of the roll over the bottom of the roll. Place a frilled toothpick in each half. Gently cut the sandwich in half on a diagonal, taking care not to crush the sandwich. Place the sandwich into a paper lined basket, off setting two halves of the sandwich lightly. Place a bag of potato chips behind the sandwich on the right rear of the basket. Place a piece of kale, cherry tomato, and a pepperoncini in the vacant area on the left rear of the basket. Success! Now it’s time to remove the pizza from the oven. When the pizza exits the oven, pick up the pizza pan with the pan grips. Be careful, it's hot! And always follow the steps for determining if a pizza is properly prepared and cooked. The crust is dark, golden brown color. The crust should be puffy, raised, and well rounded. The bottom lip should be crunchy and crisp on the exterior, tender and breadlike on the interior. The crust should be ½ inches thick on the bottom and ¾ inch thick on the lip. The lip of the crust should glisten! The cheese should be brown and well melted. Using the tip of the pie spatula, carefully lift on the corner of the crust above the lip of the pizza pan and slide the pizza out of the pan onto the cutting board. Before cutting the pizza, lightly brush garlic margarine around the lip of the pizza using a round pastry brush. Be sure to store the brush on the side of the garlic spread container. Now cut the pizza into the proper number of slices using the pizza knife. Individual gets 3 cuts, 6 slices. Small, 4 cuts, 8 slices. Medium, 5 cuts, 10 slices. Large, 6 cuts, 12 slices. Now slide your cut pizza from the cutting board onto a serving tray. Make sure that the tray is completely dry before you do this. Verify the order with the ticket and put it in the pickup window. Subtract the ticket time from the current time and call out your pizza time. 

**Employee:**

7 minute pizza!

If the order is to-go, place it in a to-go box. And, when no products are exiting the oven, be sure to keep your area clean! You’ve now been shown the Pizza Make and Oven Cut expectations and procedures in serving that quality product! Now ask your trainer questions, practice, and study your materials to further your knowledge on position. Have fun and good luck! 

**Todd Horchner:**

Make sure pizzas are served within 15 seconds to ensure freshness. If there’s not a showroom attendant around, deliver the pizza yourself. 

**Mr. Munch: (Walkaround)**

Hahaha, Todd, these pizzas look so good! Hey, why don’t you let me take one to the table?

**[Todd intercepts Munch grabbing the pizza and hands it off to an employee]**

**Todd Horchner:**

Heh, Table 5.
