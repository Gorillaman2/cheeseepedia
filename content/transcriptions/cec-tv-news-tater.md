**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Oo, ow ow! Hey! Man, I hate that part of the show. Now where was I?

**Pasqually: (Off-screen)**

You were about to introduce the commentator! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Oh yeah! In order to present as many view points as possible, we sometimes invite speakers, especially with importance to our program, to share their opinions! So, with no further ado, here is today's commentator! 

**[Scene changes to a potato behind a mic.]**

**[Pasqually laughs]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Ok, what was that supposed to be?

**[Scene shifts to Pasqually behind the camera]**

**Pasqually:**
