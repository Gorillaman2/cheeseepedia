**Singer:**

Where can a kid

Kid around?

**Dad:**

Billy!

**Singer:**

Where can he act

Like a clown?

**Mom:**

Billy!

**Singer:**

Oh what a face!

There’s just one place for a silly Billy like you

Come to Chuck E. Cheese

You can turn it loose

Make him laugh, have some fun

Be a silly goose 

You’re a kid, shout it out 

That’s what we’re all about! 

Chuck E. Cheese

Where a kid can be a kid!
