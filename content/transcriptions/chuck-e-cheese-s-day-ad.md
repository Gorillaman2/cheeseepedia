**Singer:**

What’s the best day to go to Chuck E. Cheese’s?

**Kids:**

Every day’s a Chuck E. Cheese’s day! 

**Singer:**

If you feel like going out and having fun!

**Kids: (Singing)**

Then it’s a Chuck E. Cheese’s day!

And if you like to laugh and dance and jump and play

And eat at Chuck E. Cheese’s any old day

Today’s a good day, any day’s a great day! 

Everyday’s a Chuck E. Cheese’s day! 

At Chuck E. Cheese’s 

Where a kid can be a kid!
