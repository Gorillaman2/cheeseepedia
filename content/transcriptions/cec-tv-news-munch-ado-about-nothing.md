**Narrator:**

Spanning the globe

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hey slow this thing down I’m getting dizzy here! 

**Narrator:**

It’s time for the Chuck E. Cheese News! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hello everybody! I’m Chuck E. Cheese and here’s the breaking news! 

**[Chuck drops a newspaper on the ground and it shatters]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

And here’s the late breaking news! 

**[Chuck drops another news paper and it breaks late]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hehehe, thank you! Moving on now, we go to a brand new feature on the show here so get to share some deep thoughts from a real stinker. 

**[Scene shifts to Pasqually with a cue card]**

**Pasqually:**

Chuck E, that’s *thinker*. Thinker! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Oh! Eh, sorry I mean uh- some see thoughts from a real *thinker*! Here’s “Munch ado about nothing”! 

**[Scene shifts to Munch sitting on a couch ]**

**Mr. Munch:**

Thank you Chuck E! And here’s some of the deep thoughts that I’ve been thinking on lately, do pearl onions come from oysters with bad breath? In the self check out lane, 10 items or less, can you push in a bunch a stuff if your name is Less? How come bald guys don’t spend more time at hair raising movies? And another thing, how come popcorn at the movies is so expensive when there’s gum under the seats for free? I’m Mister Munch and this is “Munch ado about nothing”! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Uh, thank you Munch. You’ve certainly gave us all something to think about uh- heheh. Whether we want to or not. And now let’s go on-

**[Jasper rushes on to the set with a board with a peach on it]**

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Hold it, hold it! We interrupt this broadcast for a very special bulletin! Board. Yup, as bulletin boards go this one is a real peach! Oh and uh, back to you Chuck E. 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Thanks Jasper! Thanks a lot! But according to Hans on the clock, we’re almost out of time 

**Hans the clock bird:**

That’s right Chuck E, we’re almost out of time! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Thank you Hans! 

**Hans:**

You’re welcome. 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

So until our next report, this is Chuck E. Cheese saying: if something important is happening somewhere, it’s news to me!
