**Young girl:**

Rainy days are the pits. You can’t run around

**Other Young Girl:**

And you have to watch Sue Ellen and JR, again! 

**Mom: (Offscreen)**

I hope you kids aren’t eating on that couch!

**Girls:**

Mom! 

**Kids: (Singing)**

But at Chuck E. Cheese’s you can act like a kid

You can have more fun than you ever did

You can giggle

You can wiggle

You can flip your lid!

Chuck E. Cheese

Where a kid, can be a kid!
