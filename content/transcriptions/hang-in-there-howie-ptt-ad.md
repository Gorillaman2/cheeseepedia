**Kids:**

Happy Birthday! Speech, speech! 

**Howie:**

When my mom asked me where to go for my birthday, I said Chuck E. Cheese’s! 

**Kids:**

Yay! Chuck E. Cheese’s! 

**Howie:**

Where everyone can go play games! 

**Boy in red shirt:**

Games?

**[Some of the kids run off to play games]**

**Howie:**

Or, uh- watch a show!

**Girl in pink skirt:**

A show?

**[More kids run to go watch a show, leaving Howie alone]**

**Howie:**

Some place where the food and fun are all there. 

**Chuck E. Cheese: (Walkaround)**

Hang in there Howie. 

**Male Singer:**

You can Smile America with Chuck E. Cheese!
