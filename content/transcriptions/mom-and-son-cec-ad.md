**[Scenes shifts back and forth from a mom hurrying from her job into a car to kids running out from a school]**

**Boy:**

Mom, I’m gonna take you out tonight! 

**Boy: (Singing)**

Let’s go to Chuck E. Cheese’s 

Our favorite place 

Full of fun 

Play games 

It’s gonna be great! 

I just want to see every smile on your face!

Chuck E. Cheese’s 

Where a kid can be a kid.
