**[Song: I'm Da Greatest]**

**Chuck E. Cheese: (singing)**

I'm da greatest, one and only famous

The masterpiece of rock & roll

If I hear ya callin', I'll be rock & rollin

To any song that you may know

Any song I sing is garunteed to please ya

So sing along and join the show

I'm da greatest, one and only famous

The masterpiece of rock & roll

So oh no, don't ever go away

Oh no, you don't want to end today

The famous greatest rat, Chuck E. Cheese is it a fact

I'm the greatest star in all of the world

Some tried to beat me, but could never defeat me

My biggest fans are boys and girls

I'm always at the top, and I'll never ever stop

Keep on goin' like a spinnin' top

I'm da greatest, one and only famous

The greatest star in all of the world

But oh no, don't ever go away

Oh no, you don't want to, you do stay

So oh no, don't ever go away

Oh no, you don't want to, you do stay
