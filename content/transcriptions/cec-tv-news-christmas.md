**Narrator:**

Spanning the globe

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Munch hold it, he said spanning the globe not sanding the globe! 

**Mr. Munch:**

Haha, I thought that sounded funny. 

**Narrator:**

It’s time for the Chuck E. Cheese News! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hi folks and thanks for tuning in to this special holiday edition of the news! Here’s our top story!

**[Scene shifts to Jasper playing with a spinning top]** 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Wow! These tops are great toys! I’ll bet you a lot of kids ask Santa for tops this year! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Uh, our *top* story. In other news, word has come down from Santa’s workshop at the North Pole that there may be some problems with the elves, take it away Pasqually! 

**[Scene shifts to Pasqually at the north pole]**

**Pasqually:**

I tell you Chuck E, these little tiny elves are making a- big trouble up here! You see they’re so small that they want to work shorter hours! Hehehe. And when they get paid, they want small bills! Haha haha! I- I think I heard that the elves are demanding a raise too! Not more money, they just want to get up to the drinking fountain! Hahaha! 

**Elf:**

Alright hold it right there! 

**Pasqually:**

Right here little fella? 

**Elf:**

None of the things you’re saying is true! We elves are very happy here, magically making toys for santa to bring to the boys and girls.

**Pasqually:**

Is that so?

**Elf:**

Yeah that’s so! You were just making everything up so you could tell those awful short jokes! And we don’t like it! 

**Pasqually:**

Oh, you’ve got a short temper! Hahaha! 

**Elf:**

I’m warning you! 

**Pasqually:**

Oh go pick on someone your own size. Heheh, like Barbie or Ken huh? 

**Elf:**

Ok I will! Presto Change-o! 

**[Pasqually shrinks to smaller than the elf]**

**Pasqually:**

Hey! I’m bambino sized! What’s the matter with you anyway you big bully? 

**Elf:**

Don’t worry, the magic will wear off *shortly*! Heheheh. 

**Pasqually:**

Oh, shortly? That’s real funny haha. And now back to you Chuck E! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Heheh, thanks Pasqually. And uh now before we go, Mr. Munch is gonna take a look at the weather! 

**[Scene shifts to Munch standing by a window]**

**Mr. Munch:**

Ok I’m looking at the weather. Back to you Chuck E. Haha. 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

No, no Munch I mean uh, what with the holidays and everything, we want to know if there’s any snow on the map. 

**[Munch gets out an actual map covered in snow]**

**Mr. Munch:**

Oh yeah we’ve got snow on the map, we’ve got snow all over the map! And that’s a fact, don’t know what it’s doing outside but there’s most definitely snow on the map for the holidays hahaha! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Thanks Munch. And thank you for spending this holiday season with us! Until next time, this is Chuck E. Cheese saying: If something important is happening somewhere, it’s news to us!
