**[Song: Biggest Fan]**

**Chuck E. Cheese: (singing)**

I'll take ya out if you want me to

I'm gonna be very nice to you

I'm gonna pick you up in my big Sedan

You're gonna find out I'm your biggest fan

I wanna tell you but I'm not very bold

Could ya understand what I'm being told

You were a child when I left you alone

Well now I'm back and I wanna stay home

I broke your heart it was so long ago

Your mother said that you would need me so

Go by my future's what I thought I'd do

But now I realize my future is you

I am sincere and I hope you'd accept

Then I'm so sorry and I'm filled with regret

Please take me back as your father once more

Don't leave me standing outside your front door

I feel so lonely and sad and old that I can't make it all up to you

I know you can't understand

Just give me the chance

I'll show you what I'll do, just for you

I'll take ya out if you want me to

I'm gonna be very nice to you

I'm gonna pick you up in my big Sedan

You're gonna find out I'm your biggest fan
