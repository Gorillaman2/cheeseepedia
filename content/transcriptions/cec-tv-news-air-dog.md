**Narrator:**

Spanning the globe

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Munch, easy with the tire pump. He said spamming the globe, not expanding the globe. 

**[the globe starts to fly around the screen]**

**Mr. Munch:**

Oops sorry. 

**Narrator:**

It’s time for the Chuck E. Cheese News! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hello everybody, I’m Chuck E. Cheese and I’m your ace reporter! In fact, here’s my card! 

**[Chuck pulls out an ace of spades]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

And I’ve got 51 more where that came from! Heheh, but now it’s time for the news. And I’ve just been told we got a real hot story coming in! 

**[Pasqually hands Chuck a newspaper that’s on fire]**

**Pasqually:**

Here ya go Chuck E! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Thanks Pasqually, OW! Wow that was hot! What was the story Pasqually? 

**Pasqually:**

“Man finds news story in pizza oven!”

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Heheh, now you tell me! But hey, even if my fingers are hot, let me turn things over to someone who can help keep all you drivers cool, Jasper T. Jowls with our helicopter traffic report! 

**[Scene shifts to Jasper in a helicopter]**

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Thank you Chuck E! Yes I’m high in the skies above Chuck E. Cheese’s right now! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Great! What’s the traffic look like up there? 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Looks great Chuck E! In fact, I don’t see any other helicopters at all around here! I’ve got the whole sky to myself! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

I mean, what’s the traffic like down on the ground!

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Oh! Well I got no idea.

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Then look down.

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Look down? No can do Chuckorino! I’ve got a fear of heights! Oh, well I guess I should have been an air dale! So, back to you in the studio. 

**Chuck E. Cheese:** 

Well, one piece of good news for all you drivers, at least Jasper isn’t on the road right now! 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Hey I heard that! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

And now let’s turn our attention to money matters! Because, let’s face it, money matters! So here’s Pasqually with our very latest stock report! 

**Pasqually:**

Thank you Chuck E! Ahem, the kitchen door, one of the drawers where I keep the spoons, and a piece of bubble gum under the table! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Er, what do those things have to do with the stock report? 

**Pasqually:**

Oh? Oh, oh! The stock report! I thought you wanted the *stuck* report! The drawer, the door, and the gum, those are all things that are stuck! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Uh huh, and I’m stuck without anything else to tell you guys. But that’s ok cause we’re out of time anyway! So until our next report, this is Chuck E. Cheese saying: if something important is happening somewhere, it’s news to me! 

**[Jasper crashes the helicopter into the news room]**

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Am I down yet?
