Spanning the globe

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Psst, Munch. What happened to our globe?

**Mr. Munch:**

I had to take it into the shop to get it rotated

**[Narrator laughs]**

**Narrator:**

It’s time for- hahaha!  The- the Chuck E. Cheese News! Wa hahaha! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Hey there everybody! I gotta talk to that announcer, I’m Chuck E. Cheese and here are the news briefs. 

**[Chuck holds up a pair of briefs with the word news on them]**

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Yup here they are! And Uh- hey did somebody put starch in my news briefs again? Gee I really hate that. And speaking of things that will make you sit up straight, here’s Jasper T. Jowls, our rover reporter, with some exciting news! 

**[Scene shifts to Jasper in front of some cop cars]**

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Thank you Chuck E! I’m in the scene of a big story here, there are police all around me and I’m told that they are just about to collar someone who’s been breaking the law! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Wow that is exciting! And we’ll come back to Jasper just as soon as the police collar that criminal. But first, we go to a field report from a little town of Yeast Packet, Idaho where residents have just baked the world’s largest pizza! Over to you Pasqually! 

**[Scene shifts to Pasqually at a fair]**

**Pasqually:**

Yes Chuck E, it’s a big day here in Yeast Packet, because they’ve made one big pizza! I’ve never seen anything like it, it’s huge, stupendous, classical, magnificent, oh it’s incredible! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Amazing! Can you give us a more specific idea just how big the world’s biggest pizza is? 

**[Pasqually holds up a pepperoni the size of his head]**

**Pasqually:**

Well sure! Just look at this! Heheh. Nice eh? 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Er, Pasqually that doesn’t look like such a big pizza. 

**Pasqually:**

Chuck E! This isn’t the pizza, this is just one of the slices of pepperoni! Mama Mia this thing is big! 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Oh ho, and there you have it folks! The world’s largest pizza, although you already know where to find the world’s tastiest pizza heheh.  Plug. And now let’s go back to Jasper T. Jowls and see if the police have collared that criminal! 

**[Scene shifts to Jasper with a collar on and the police leaving]**

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Yeah, yeah they collared him. Big deal. 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Say Jasper, isn’t that a new collar that you’re wearing? 

**Jasper T. Jowls:**

Ok, ok, so I forgot to wear my dog collar big deal! I didn’t think the police would come out here just to put it on me. Oh I am so embarrassed! Back to you Chuck E. 

**Chuck E. Cheese:**

Well, there’s a story you’re not gonna see anywhere else! And in fact, you’re not gonna see anymore stories here either, cause we’re all out of time! Good thing too, this show is going to the dogs. So until our next report, this is Chuck E. Cheese saying: if something important is happening somewhere, it’s news to me!
