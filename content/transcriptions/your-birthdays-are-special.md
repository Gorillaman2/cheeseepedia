**Chuck E. Cheese: (Singing)**

Each day’s a present, we all get to open

A wondrous gift, wrapped in every sunrise 

A present to cherish, with each passing moment

A memory unfolding, in front of our eyes

Some of them faded, some I can see clearly 

This one I’ll always, hold close to me dearly 

Because your birthdays are special

Each one is special

They’ll always be special to me

Each years a journey, a brand new adventure 

Brimming with promise, as big as the sky 

Shining like star light, but silent like wishes 

On candles that shine for each year that’s gone by

Some moments stay with us, others are missing

As you blow out the candles, for you I am wishing

That your birthday are special 

Each one is special 

They’ll always be special to me

And the sun will keep shining, on the earth that’s below us

What our minds will not show us, we know in our hearts

Life is a sweet song, we all sing in chorus 

A road stretched before us, to places unknown 

So many chances, to sing Happy Birthday 

Perhaps I’ll share birthdays, with kids of your own

All of these moments, the good times together

I hope they’ll stay with you, and you’ll always remember 

That your birthdays were special 

Each one was special 

They’ll be special to me

Yeah they’ll always be special
 
To me
