**Boy:**

So just the other day, my dad says “Hey guys, let's have pizza!”. Then he asked me what I want on the pizza. So I said: “Everything! Lots of cheese! Pepperoni’s! Spaceships, cars, balls, a helicopter. Mushrooms, slides, a bus, skee balls, race cars, robots, games, hoops, a mouse.”. You know, the works. They got the picture!
