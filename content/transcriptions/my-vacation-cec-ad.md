**[Kids laughing]**

**Girl:**

My vacation. On the way out of town we went to Chuck E. Cheese! 

**Kids:**

Wow! 

**Girl:**

I played a whole lot of games, I rode all the rides and I jumped in the ball crawl 800 times! 

**Kids:**

Ooo. 

**Girl:**

And I ate a whole pizza all by myself! 

**Kids:**

Oh boy! 

**Girl:**

And then we went to the Grand Canyon. 

**Kids:**

Awwww.

**Kids: (Singing)**

Chuck E. Cheese

Where a kid can be a kid.
